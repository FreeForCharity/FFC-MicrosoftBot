# FFCMicrosoftBot
Given the excellent capabilities of modern bots to help website users and the amazing offer by Microsoft for non profits for free azure credits (nonprofit.microsoft.com) Free For Charity is looking to adopt this technology for our main site (https://freeforcharity.org) our free hosting platform (https://ffchosting.org) and our client management platform running WHMCS (https://ffchosting.org/hub)
To get started take a look at the Microsoft learning path (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/create-bots-with-the-azure-bot-service/) and contact clarkemoyer@freeforcharity.org or chrisrae@freeforcharity.org for possible assignments, paid tools, and other items that would support this effort.
